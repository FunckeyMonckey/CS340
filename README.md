### _How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?_

For a program to be maintainable, readable, and adaptable you need to explain the purpose of each function, seperate your code into blocks, and create a function to make repedable features accessible and out of the way.

### _What were the advantages of working in this way?_

The advantage of working this way is that the code is easily readable by not only you, but others, along with the ease of not having to rewrite functions. It also allows you to easily find errors within the code.

### _How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?_

The CRUD python module is a simple means to create, read, update and delete information. In most if not all programs there is going to be a way to save information. Using CRUD allows you to easily have a means to access that information.

### _How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?_

To approach a problem, you need to figure out what the goal of the program/function is. After knowing the goal, you can follow each step the program takes and find out where the issue is. Once you know where the issues are, you only need to fix and repeat until the goal is achieved without error.

### _How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?_

I wouldn’t say I approached this project any differently from the previous one, other than the fact I didn’t know how to use mongodb at the beginning. Having the same approach to every project allows me to be consistent and not result in taking it easy; that could result in errors that would result in more effort and time.

### _What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?_

Using CRUD is something that will always be useful in the creation of databases. Along with focusing on the aspects that the client believes to be most important.

### _What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?_

Computer scientists create and manage programs that help industries run automated tools. Without these programs many tasks would either disappear or result in many complications.

### _How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?_

This type of project allows companies like Grazioso Salvare to have a means to keep and manage records with ease. Having a database allows the employees to find the information they need quickly and efficiently so that they can go back to completing their work.
